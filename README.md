In this project, we use K-means clustering to predict the Income spent. We categorize the information based on amount spend.                 
                             
Procedure:                                                                                                                             
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.                                                                                       
=> Collect dataset of Engine energy parameters.                                                                                      
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.                                                                                      
=> We segregate and Zip dataset.                                                                                      
=> We use K-means clustering algorithm.                                                                                      
=> Obtain best K value by elbow Method.                                                                                      
=> Fit the model.                                                                                      
=> Visualise the data.
